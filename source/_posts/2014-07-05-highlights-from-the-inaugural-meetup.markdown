Our fledgling St. Louis QS meetup group got off to a great start with our first [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/QS-STL/events/157767622/)
Tuesday evening, Jan. 21, 2014.  The event was held at the [Farrell Learning and Teaching Center](http://fltc.wustl.edu/) on the
Washington University campus. The meeting started off with a round of introductions and comments from the three organizers:
[Will Dahl](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/william-dahl/15/407/274), [Karren Watkins](https://twitter.com/k_chirp), and [Dan Reus](https://twitter.com/DanReus).
They articulated their vision for the group and elicited feedback from the audience.

The event was a 'show and tell' type meetup, with three scheduled presenters:

Jim McCarter - Jim is an MD, PhD who tracks many, many metrics related to his health. He presented on his experience measuring,
supplementing, and re-measuring his Omega 3 fatty acid levels over a course of 6 months. He related this to the growing phenomenon of
[Citizen Science](http://www.scientificamerican.com/citizen-science/) in which people utilize self-tracking and self-experimentation to arrive at new insights.

Karren Watkins - Karren is a research associate at Washington University’s Olin Business School and uses a device, called a [Sociometer](http://www.sociometricsolutions.com/),
to capture group dynamics and interpersonal skills in student teams. She shared how wearing a sociometer can reveal unnoticed patterns in
team settings and covered the challenges of developing useful feedback reports  and data visualizations for students.

Dan Reus - Dan is the founder of [Openly Disruptive](http://openlydisruptive.org/), which explores the junction where ideas, technology, and context meet in our evolving world.
He discussed issues related to the transfer (or lack thereof) of health-related data between patients and healthcare providers, rooted in
his own history with the heart condition ventricular tachycardia. Dan has rebounded back from that situation in organizing an initiative known
as Metronome. Metronome seeks to break down “trust” barriers in medical data transfer, empowering all parties to take appropriate action.

We had a great turnout for our first event (and can’t wait for the [next one](http://www.meetup.com/QS-STL/events/167014482/?a=ra1_vl&_af_eid=167014482&_af=event)!) - over
30 people, from a variety of industries and backgrounds. Major thanks to the [BALSA Group](http://www.thebalsagroup.org/) for sponsoring the event and providing food and drinks!
