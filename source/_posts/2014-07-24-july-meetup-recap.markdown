Thanks to the 20+ self quantifiers who came out for a fun and engaging meetup on Tuesday evening! There are a number
of things to remark on:

#### *Quantified Self St. Louis hits 100 Members*
First off, we would like to congratulate the group on reaching 100 members! The St. Louis Quantified Self community has
proven to be diverse and engaging on a number of levels. We look forward to continued learning and interaction as
the trend of gaining insights through data and tracking grows.

#### *QS Screening + Discussion Recap*
Thanks to everyone that came out to a packed QS screening at Lab 1500 this evening. Of the top 10 videos on our
[shortlist](https://github.com/QuantifiedSTL/QuantifiedSTL.github.io/wiki/Choosing-QS-presentations-to-watch),
the audience selected three thought-provoking presentations:

* [Jamie Aspinall - Location History](http://vimeo.com/99571921) A fascinating presentation where Jamie
shared visualization of 4+ years of Google Location data - which offered an excellent perspective on making
personalized sense of a vast array (4.5 million+ lines of JSON) of information through travels locally and abroad.
* [Roger Craig Wins Jeopardy Championship with Knowledge Tracking](http://quantifiedself
.com/2011/11/roger-craig-on-knowledge-tracking/) Of particular note is how Roger was able to accumulate crowd
sourced data to build a systematic model that transitioned from the 'quantified self' to the 'predicted self' to the
 'simulated self' - and how that might be applied toward other niche areas both personal and commercial.
* [Maggie Delano on ECG and Activity Tracking](http://vimeo.com/77972740) Demonstrating the empowering nature of
collecting and studying your own data, Maggie was able to detect her own heart arrhythmia. A great presentation that
prompted discussion in our group on a number of topics within the medical tracking sphere.

There seemed to be a consensus that this new screening format was worthwhile, and so we will likely do another one in
 six months or so. More videos and commentary are updated on a near-daily basis from 160+ worldwide chapters on the
 main [QS blog](http://quantifiedself.com/), an ample resource to choose from.

Several attendees walked over to the nearby [Gelateria Tavolini](http://www.gelateriatavolini.com/) afterward to
partake in some sweets and stimulating conversation, always nice to see that happen.

#### *AliveCor ECG Giveaway*
As part of Tuesday's event, we announced the future giveaway of a smart phone-enabled [AliveCor](http://www.alivecor.com/home)
ECG monitor. This QS device was recently approved by the FDA and is one of the most sought after products
in the health/medical space at the moment. Stay tuned for more details on how to win it! Special thanks to Ben
Johnson from [BioSTL](http://biostl.org/) for providing the donation.


#### *Followup on June's Civic Hacking Projects*
This past June, the QS group entered the [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://buildforstl.org/) - resulting in two
quantified projects that are taking shape:

* A context-sensitive geo-polling app/initiative that would allow communities to measure community well-being
sentiment in various areas (e.g. happiness, safety, etc.).
* A Personal Environmental Tracker (PET) that will allow citizens in the St. Louis area to keep tabs not only on
their own environmental impact, but also of their community as a whole in an engaging way.

If you are interested in finding out more and/or participating in either of these projects at any level, please let us
know.

#### *Announcement of Co-Organizer Transition from Karren Watkins to Jamie Williams*

Lastly, we made a bittersweet announcement: Karren Watkins ([@k_chirp](https://twitter.com/k_chirp)) will be
transitioning out of her co-organizer role,
while maintaining her involvement as a member of the St. Louis Quantified Self community. Many of you who have met
Karren know that she has been performing her own QS research in the field of Organizational
Behavior – which was even the subject of one of our first QS Show & Tell presentations! As this research continues
to pick up, Karren will be giving even more focus and will even shortly be applying to Ph.D. programs in the field.

Dan and I would like to personally thank Karren for all of her hard work and dedication from the inception of the
Quantified Self St. Louis Meetup - we could not have done it without her. Most of all,
we wish her great success in her future endeavors in the QS space and look forward to seeing her at future events!

At the same time, we will be introducing a new co-organizer – Jamie Williams ([@jamieinfinity](https://twitter
.com/jamieinfinity)). Jamie is a physicist-turned-developer
with a longstanding interest in the QS space. Prior to coming to St. Louis this past year,
Jamie was involved in the Chicago QS Meetup group and even initiated a separate QS chapter in Champaign-Urbana before
moving to St. Louis.

We’re excited to look toward more good things to come!
